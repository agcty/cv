\section{Experience}


\cventry{07/2020-now}{Full-stack Developer at Zerolens}{Digital photography VR startup}{}{}{

Currently leading a team of 4, responsible for reviewing PRs, CI/CD, building AWS \& GCS integrations and releasing new versions of our app. Technologies used include React, TailwindCSS, Firebase, Docker and ThreeJs.
}

\section{Motivation}

\cventry{}{Decentralized future \& open source}{}{}{}{I am a big advocate for decentralization and open source software. While politicians and banks seem to hold on to dogmatic beliefs, not being able to embrace and adopt new technologies, I believe it is our duty as developers to stop at nothing to advance. Technologies like Blockchain, VR and AI are in the process of being merged together and a technological explosion is just around the corner. Now we only need to make it happen. My biggest interest right now is the crypto space: DeFi, on-chain Governance, NFTs, and programmable money fuel the growth for true decentralization. However, telling a story of how passionate you are is not worth anything, it's the concrete actions that you take that matter. That's why I participate in crowdloans such as Karura, Moonriver, Centrifuge \& Kilt and stake my KAR (PS: can't wait for LKSM). While I'm not a blockchain expert, I'm very proficient in full-stack technologies and startup methodologies and demonstrate this on a daily basis at my current job. Diving deep into Web3 APIs will not be an issue and if given the chance to build something I believe in, I will outwork everyone. I look forward to the future and I hope to be a part of it.}
